tiny chao garden for PC

This is a unity project to develop a re-creation of the Tiny Chao Garden from Sonic Advance for PC. 
The intended purpose for this project is to develop a desktop tamagotchi like chao garden in which
you can play with chao, but also seamlesssly import/export .chao files from steam copies of 
Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2.
